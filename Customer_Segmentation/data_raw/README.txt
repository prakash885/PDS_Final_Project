Customer Segmentation Project Overview:

In todayâ€™s competitive market, the ability of businesses to deliver highly personalized services is crucial for success. Achieving this level of customization requires effective customer segmentation or classification. By understanding different customer segments, organizations can align their products and services more precisely with consumer needs, leading to enhanced satisfaction and increased revenue.

The goal of this project is to use unsupervised learning methods to segment customers into distinct clusters based on personal attributes such as age, gender, income, and spending behavior. Through these clusters, businesses can identify patterns within their customer base, allowing them to better target and customize their offerings. This approach ensures that services are more relevant, improving customer engagement and overall business performance.

The analysis leverages the mall_customers.csv dataset, which contains key demographic and behavioral data of customers from a shopping mall. The dataset features the following columns: CustomerID (a unique identifier for each customer), Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100). These attributes provide a foundation for segmentation, enabling the exploration of relationships between age, income, and spending behaviors.

To uncover meaningful customer segments, this project applies clustering algorithms such as KMeans and DBSCAN. KMeans partitions the data into a specified number of clusters by finding the centroids and iteratively updating them until the optimal division is reached. DBSCAN, on the other hand, identifies clusters based on density, allowing it to discover non-linear shapes and identify outliers. Using these methods, we can group customers based on their unique attributes, helping businesses refine their strategies and deliver more tailored services.
